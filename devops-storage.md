Musings on Getting DevOps (Culture) to Storage 

In addition to the traditional storage requirements (Reliability, Snapshots, Disaster Recovery, Encryption, QoS), the DevOps Movement requires the storage products to support the following: 
- Continous Deployment ( Software Defined Deployment of Storage Infrastructure)
- API Driven (Provisioning and Monitoring)
- Faster Provisioning (Containers can be spawned in seconds)
- High Availability with Guarenteed Latency (Resilient to underlying storage infra operations)
- ScaleOut (#volumes) (Auto Scaling of Containers)
- Faster Migration to new environments ( Across clusters or Cloud Providers/Hybrid Cloud )
